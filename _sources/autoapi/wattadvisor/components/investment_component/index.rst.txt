   :type lifespan: float
   :param interest_rate: Interest rate to determine annuity factor for investment calculation of the component
   :type interest_rate: float

   Create a new model by parsing and validating input data from keyword arguments.

   Raises [`ValidationError`][pydantic_core.ValidationError] if the input data cannot be
   validated to form a valid model.
